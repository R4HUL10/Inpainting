Semantic Inpainting using Stable Diffusion

Overview
This project focuses on advancing semantic image inpainting, a challenging task involving the restoration or filling of significant gaps or damaged areas in images. Traditional methods often struggle with contextual signals when dealing with extensive missing regions. To address these challenges, our project introduces an innovative approach, leveraging the power of Stable Diffusion, specifically with the advanced SD-XL Inpainting 0.1 model.

Key Features
SD-XL Inpainting 0.1: Our project harnesses the capabilities of SD-XL Inpainting 0.1, a state-of-the-art image inpainting application grounded in deep learning and generative modeling.

Stable Diffusion Technique: The project utilizes Stable Diffusion, ensuring smooth and coherent inpainting results, particularly effective in scenarios with large missing areas.

Enhanced UNet Architecture: SD-XL Inpainting 0.1 extensively utilizes an enhanced UNet architecture with specialized inpainting channels, designed for improved accuracy and realism.

Text-Conditional Inpainting: The application allows users to add prompt text, enhancing customization and providing an interactive element for inpainting outcomes.
